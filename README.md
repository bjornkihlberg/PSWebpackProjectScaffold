# PSWebpackProjectScaffold
An example demonstrating how
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
is used to automatically bundle
[PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/)
together with *index.html* into a *dist*-folder.

A small demonstration of
[PureScript FFI](https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/guides/FFI.md)
is demonstrated as well.
